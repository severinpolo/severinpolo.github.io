I am a PhD student in the group of [Leticia Gonz√°lez](https://theochem.univie.ac.at/) and currently working on new
methododolgy for the efficient simulation of excited state dynamics in the [SHARC package](https://sharc-md.org/).

I am generally interested in method development, high performance computing, and data analysis. Throughout my education 
and journey in developing software, I have come in contact with various frameworks and languages. I am always keen on
learning and taking on new challenges.
