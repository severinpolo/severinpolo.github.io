Theoretical chemist turned software engineer/computational scientist at [FAACTs](https://www.faccts.de/)

I hold a PhD in theoretical chemistry and have been studying in Munich, Zurich,
and Vienna. Throughout my education and journey into software engineering, I have contributed to open-source scientific and corporate software in various 
international teams, where I came into contact with changing frameworks and languages. 

I love solving puzzles, learning, and challenging myself while diving into new and exciting projects.
