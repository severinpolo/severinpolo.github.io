Theoretical chemist turned software engineer/computational scientist at [FAACTs](https://www.faccts.de/)

I hold a PhD in theoretical chemistry and have studied in Munich, Zurich
and Vienna. Throughout my education and journey in software engineering, I have contributed to open-source scientific and corporate software in various 
international teams, and came into contact with changing frameworks and languages. 

I love solving puzzles, learning and challenging myself while diving into new and exciting projects.
