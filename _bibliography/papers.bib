    abstract = {We present a theoretical framework for a hybrid linear vibronic coupling
        model electrostatically embedded into a molecular mechanics environment, termed
            the linear vibronic coupling/molecular mechanics (LVC/MM) method, for the
            surface hopping including arbitrary coupling (SHARC) molecular dynamics
            package. Electrostatic embedding is realized through the computation of
            interactions between environment point charges and distributed multipole
            expansions (DMEs, up to quadrupoles) that represent each electronic state and
            transition densities in the diabatic basis. The DME parameters are obtained
            through a restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit, which we extended to
            yield higher-order multipoles. We also implemented in SHARC a scheme for
            achieving roto-translational invariance of LVC models as well as a general
            quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) interface, an OpenMM interface,
        and restraining potentials for simulating liquid droplets. Using thioformaldehyde
            in water as a test case, we demonstrate that LVC/MM can accurately reproduce
            the solvation structure and energetics of rigid solutes, with errors on the
            order of 1--2 kcal/mol compared to a BP86/MM reference. The implementation in
            SHARC is shown to be very efficient, enabling the simulation of trajectories
            on the nanosecond time scale in a matter of days.},

    abstract = {Photoinduced dynamics in solution is governed by mutual solute--solvent
        interactions, which give rise to phenomena like solvatochromism, the Stokes shift,
        dual fluorescence, or charge transfer. Understanding these phenomena requires
            simulating the solute's photoinduced dynamics and simultaneously resolving the
            three-dimensional solvent distribution dynamics. If using trajectory surface
            hopping (TSH) to this aim, thousands of trajectories are required to adequately
            sample the time-dependent three-dimensional solvent distribution functions, and
            thus resolve the solvent dynamics with sub-{\AA}ngstrom and femtosecond accuracy
            and sufficiently low noise levels. Unfortunately, simulating thousands of
            trajectories with TSH in the framework of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular
            mechanical (QM/MM) can be prohibitively expensive when employing ab initio
            electronic structure methods. To tackle this challenge, we recently introduced a
            computationally efficient approach that combines efficient linear vibronic
            coupling models with molecular mechanics (LVC/MM) via electrostatic embedding
            [Polonius et al., JCTC 2023, 19, 7171--7186]. This method provides
            solvent-embedded, nonadiabatically coupled potential energy surfaces while scaling
                similarly to MM force fields. Here, we employ TSH with LVC/MM to unravel the
                photoinduced dynamics of two small thiocarbonyl compounds solvated in water.
                We describe how to estimate the number of trajectories required to produce
                nearly noise-free three-dimensional solvent distribution functions and present
                an analysis based on approximately 10,000 trajectories propagated for 3 ps. In
                the electronic ground state, both molecules exhibit in-plane hydrogen bonds to
                the sulfur atom. Shortly after excitation, these bonds are broken and reform
                perpendicular to the molecular plane on timescales that differ by an order of
                magnitude due to steric effects. We also show that the solvent relaxation
                dynamics is coupled to the electronic dynamics, including intersystem
                crossing. These findings are relevant to advance the understanding of the
                coupled solute--solvent dynamics of solvated photoexcited molecules, e.g.,
        biologically relevant thio-nucleobases.}
