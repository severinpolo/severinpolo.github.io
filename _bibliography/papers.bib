                                          the linear vibronic coupling/molecular mechanics (LVC/MM) method, for the
                                          surface hopping including arbitrary coupling (SHARC) molecular dynamics
                                          package. Electrostatic embedding is realized through the computation of
                                          interactions between environment point charges and distributed multipole
                                          expansions (DMEs, up to quadrupoles) that represent each electronic state and
                                          transition densities in the diabatic basis. The DME parameters are obtained
                                          through a restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit, which we extended to
                                          yield higher-order multipoles. We also implemented in SHARC a scheme for
                                          achieving roto-translational invariance of LVC models as well as a general
                                          quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) interface, an OpenMM interface,
                                      and restraining potentials for simulating liquid droplets. Using thioformaldehyde
                                          in water as a test case, we demonstrate that LVC/MM can accurately reproduce
                                          the solvation structure and energetics of rigid solutes, with errors on the
                                          order of 1--2 kcal/mol compared to a BP86/MM reference. The implementation in
                                          SHARC is shown to be very efficient, enabling the simulation of trajectories
                                          on the nanosecond time scale in a matter of days.},

                              abstract = {Photoinduced dynamics in solution is governed by mutual solute--solvent
                                  interactions, which give rise to phenomena like solvatochromism, the Stokes shift,
                                  dual fluorescence, or charge transfer. Understanding these phenomena requires
                                      simulating the solute's photoinduced dynamics and simultaneously resolving the
                                      three-dimensional solvent distribution dynamics. If using trajectory surface
                                      hopping (TSH) to this aim, thousands of trajectories are required to adequately
                                      sample the time-dependent three-dimensional solvent distribution functions, and
                                      thus resolve the solvent dynamics with sub-{\AA}ngstrom and femtosecond accuracy
                                      and sufficiently low noise levels. Unfortunately, simulating thousands of
                                      trajectories with TSH in the framework of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular
                                      mechanical (QM/MM) can be prohibitively expensive when employing ab initio
                                      electronic structure methods. To tackle this challenge, we recently introduced a
                                      computationally efficient approach that combines efficient linear vibronic
                                      coupling models with molecular mechanics (LVC/MM) via electrostatic embedding
                                      [Polonius et al., JCTC 2023, 19, 7171--7186]. This method provides
                                      solvent-embedded, nonadiabatically coupled potential energy surfaces while scaling
                                          similarly to MM force fields. Here, we employ TSH with LVC/MM to unravel the
                                          photoinduced dynamics of two small thiocarbonyl compounds solvated in water.
                                          We describe how to estimate the number of trajectories required to produce
                                          nearly noise-free three-dimensional solvent distribution functions and present
                                          an analysis based on approximately 10,000 trajectories propagated for 3 ps. In
                                          the electronic ground state, both molecules exhibit in-plane hydrogen bonds to
                                          the sulfur atom. Shortly after excitation, these bonds are broken and reform
                                          perpendicular to the molecular plane on timescales that differ by an order of
                                          magnitude due to steric effects. We also show that the solvent relaxation
                                          dynamics is coupled to the electronic dynamics, including intersystem
                                          crossing. These findings are relevant to advance the understanding of the
                                          coupled solute--solvent dynamics of solvated photoexcited molecules, e.g.,
                                  biologically relevant thio-nucleobases.}
